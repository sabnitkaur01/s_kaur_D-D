## ``Drag&Drop``

# Basic javascript stuff

this is the first time we used ``javascript`` and did drag and drop project. We learnt how to drag and drop pictures and we made puzzle box with different backgrounds.

## prerequities
Drag and drop should work well. Whenever we drag and drop image it should not overlap on each other and should reset automatically on other page.
